#### Essay - Sigal Druckman 

### 1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?
In recent years, I have done a lot of contemplation on how I can spend my life and career developing my true passions. 
When I first moved to the United States from Israel we lived with my cousin who is a computer programmer.  
This was my first experience with computer programming and I was surprised how fascinating and curious I became on the subject.
It peaked my curiosity and I have been trying to learn as much as I can ever since. 
I truly enjoyed building my own website last year which motivated me to take a few courses with Code Academy in HTML, CSS in addition to Introduction to Python at Kal Academy.
Learning more has just fueled my desire to become a computer programmer
I enjoy the puzzle of the challenge of creating, figuring out solutions and the satisfaction of success!
I look forward to challenging myself in a more comprehensive program that will challenge me academically and creatively.

### 2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?
With my education from Ada, I wish to work for a local software company where I can further develop my skills and learn more about how the industry works.
My goal is to eventually become a Front End Web Developer where I will be able to utilize my computer skills and the creativity.
Helping customer to create website from scratch and adding user experience and improvement to their website.  

### 3. After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community? http://adadevelopersacademy.org/program
I deeply appreciate Ada’s Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement and feel as though I have a lot to offer this institution. 
I grew up in Israel in a special community called a “Kiboutz” which is the Hebrew word for a communal settlement. 
This was a rural community dedicated to mutual aid, social justice with a socioeconomic system based on the principle of joint ownership of property, equality and cooperation of production consumption, and education.
This all stems from fulfillment of the idea “from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs”. 
While my parents still reside in the Kiboutz, I ventured to the Pacific Northwest to raise my family in a peaceful country with more opportunities for my children.
I am thankful to have found a school that shares my ideals growing up in Israel where you are appreciated for your special abilities and skills, yet are a part of a community working towards a greater good. 
I continue to practice these values today with my son Elai and my extensive work volunteering with youth. 
Giving back to the community has and will be a continuing passion of mine and I hope that my education will provide me the skills to share that with young women in need. 
I would love the opportunity to pass along my knowledge, and show them what technology has to offer the young women of our community!

### 4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?
There is one mistake in my life that has nothing to do with technology that I would like to share as it
deeply impacted the course of my life.  When I was 18 I was drafted into the Israeli Army, as it is mandatory in Israel. 
The year before I was to enter I received a letter that requested I fill out a list of goals, desires and potential jobs
you are interested in while you serve. Yet, at this time in my life I was focused on becoming a professional dancer and thus avoiding military service.
Unfortunately that did not turn out the way I’d hoped and I ended up going into the military. 
Since I did not fill out the prior form I had no say in where I was stationed or the job I entered.
Therefore, I was stuck in menial positions that did not fit my skills, capabilities or knowledge.
It was a very difficult and frustrating couple of years full of strife and unhappiness that ultimately led me to pursue a life in the United States. 
While I am grateful for the life experience, if I could do it again I would have taken a greater interest in being assertive and taking control of my life. 
I learned that I should take every opportunity given to me and be true to my values and gifts.
